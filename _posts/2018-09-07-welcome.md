Title: Welcome

It's been a long while since I've tried to maintain a blog - I've switched jobs a few times, worked with a lot of really cool people and on a lot of awesome products, and completely switched stacks along the way.

There's so much that I've learned from other people's writing and I want to start sharing some of the things that I've worked on that might help other people. Recently, I've been working with Python/Django, Javascript/React, AWS infrastructure, and cyber-security in general, so that probebaly where my writing will tend toward.
